## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Financial time-series prediction presents unique challenges that traditional machine learning approaches often fail to address adequately. Stock prices exhibit complex temporal dependencies, varying volatility patterns, and distribution shifts over time that require specialized modeling techniques. Standard loss functions like Mean Squared Error (MSE) optimize for point prediction accuracy but ignore crucial financial characteristics such as volatility matching, temporal consistency, and directional accuracy.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Existing approaches to stock price prediction suffer from several limitations:

1. **Temporal Inconsistency**: Predictions often exhibit unrealistic jumps between consecutive time points
2. **Volatility Mismatch**: Models fail to capture the true risk characteristics of financial instruments
3. **Distribution Shift**: Natural price appreciation over time creates systematic bias in predictions
4. **Feature Correlation Dynamics**: Relationships between technical indicators and prices evolve during training
5. **Evaluation Bias**: Traditional metrics don't account for financial-specific performance requirements

### 1.3 Contributions

This paper makes the following key contributions:

1. **Novel Time-Series Adaptive Loss Function** combining correlation-based adaptation with temporal penalties
2. **Comprehensive Financial Evaluation Framework** with bias-corrected metrics
3. **Real-Time Market Data Integration** using Schwab API for fresh 10-year historical data
4. **Comparative Analysis** across different market conditions (mature vs. growth stocks)
5. **Production-Ready Implementation** with robust error handling and authentication workflows

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Time-Series Adaptive Loss Function

Our adaptive loss function extends the traditional MSE approach with multiple components specifically designed for financial time-series:

```
L_adaptive = L_MSE + Σ(w_i × |cov(f_i, y)|) + α×L_temporal + β×L_volatility + γ×L_smoothness
```

Where:
- **L_MSE**: Base mean squared error for prediction accuracy
- **Σ(w_i × |cov(f_i, y)|)**: Weighted correlation terms with adaptive weights
- **L_temporal**: Temporal consistency penalty
- **L_volatility**: Volatility matching penalty
- **L_smoothness**: Smoothness regularization penalty

### 2.2 Temporal Consistency Penalty

The temporal consistency penalty encourages smooth transitions between consecutive predictions:

```
L_temporal = (1/T) × Σ(t=1 to T-1) |ŷ(t+1) - ŷ(t)|
```

This penalty reduces unrealistic price jumps and promotes more stable prediction sequences, which is crucial for financial applications where extreme volatility should be justified by market conditions.

### 2.3 Volatility Matching Penalty

Financial instruments have characteristic volatility patterns that should be preserved in predictions:

```
L_volatility = |σ(Δŷ) - σ(Δy)|
```

Where:
- **σ(Δŷ)**: Standard deviation of predicted price changes
- **σ(Δy)**: Standard deviation of actual price changes

This ensures that the model captures the true risk characteristics of the financial instrument.

### 2.4 Smoothness Regularization

The smoothness penalty uses second derivatives to reduce high-frequency noise:

```
L_smoothness = (1/T-2) × Σ(t=2 to T-1) |ŷ(t+1) - 2×ŷ(t) + ŷ(t-1)|
```

This penalty promotes realistic price movements by penalizing excessive acceleration in predictions.

### 2.5 Adaptive Weight Update Mechanism

Weights for correlation terms are updated every 5 epochs using:

```
w_new = w_old × (1 + α × σ(cov_normalized))
```

With constraints: `w ∈ [0.01, 0.2]` for stability, where:
- **α = 0.1**: Conservative learning rate for weight updates
- **σ(x) = 2/(1 + e^(-5x)) - 1**: Sigmoid normalization function

### 2.6 Feature Engineering for Time-Series

We engineer 17 technical indicators specifically for financial time-series:

#### Price-Based Features:
- **price_range**: High - Low (intraday volatility)
- **price_change**: Close - Open (session performance)
- **price_volatility**: price_range / Open (normalized volatility)

#### Moving Averages:
- **ma_5, ma_10, ma_20**: Short, medium, and long-term trends
- **rsi_signal**: (Close - ma_10) / ma_10 (relative strength)

#### Volume Indicators:
- **volume_ma**: 10-period volume moving average
- **volume_ratio**: Current volume / volume_ma (volume surge detection)

#### Lag Features:
- **prev_close, prev_volume, prev_high, prev_low**: Previous session values

#### Temporal Features:
- **time_of_day**: Hour + minute/60 (intraday patterns)

- **Smoothness Penalty Weight**: γ = 0.001

These conservative weights ensure stability while providing meaningful regularization.
