## üéØ Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and concise

### Code Formatting

We use `black` for code formatting:
```bash
pip install black
black .
```

### Documentation

- Update README.md if adding new features
- Add docstrings following Google style
- Update the white paper for significant algorithmic changes

### Example Function Documentation

```python
def compute_adaptive_weight(covariance_history: List[float], 
                          learning_rate: float = 0.1) -> float:
    """
    Compute adaptive weight based on covariance history.
    
    Args:
        covariance_history: List of recent covariance values
        learning_rate: Learning rate for weight updates
        
    Returns:
        Updated weight value constrained to [0.01, 0.5]
        
    Example:
        >>> history = [0.5, 0.6, 0.4, 0.7, 0.5]
        >>> weight = compute_adaptive_weight(history)
        >>> print(f"New weight: {weight}")
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Adding Tests

When adding new functionality, please include tests:

```python
def test_adaptive_loss_function():
    """Test adaptive loss function computation."""
    feature_names = ['feature1', 'feature2']
    loss_fn = AdaptiveLossFunction(feature_names)
    
    # Test with dummy data
    features = torch.randn(32, 2)
    target = torch.randn(32, 1)
    predictions = torch.randn(32, 1)
    
    loss, corr_losses = loss_fn(predictions, target, features)
    
    assert isinstance(loss, torch.Tensor)
    assert len(corr_losses) == len(feature_names)
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python3 -m pytest

# Run specific test file
python3 -m pytest tests/test_adaptive_loss.py

# Run with coverage
python3 -m pytest --cov=.
```

## üìä Research Contributions

### Adding New Datasets

When adding support for new datasets:

1. Create a new data loading function following the pattern:
   ```python
   def load_your_dataset() -> pd.DataFrame:
       """Load and preprocess your dataset."""
       # Implementation
       pass
   ```

2. Update the main script to support the new dataset
3. Document the dataset characteristics in the white paper
4. Include performance results in your pull request

### Algorithmic Improvements

For new adaptive loss variants:

1. Implement as a new class inheriting from `nn.Module`
2. Follow the same interface as `AdaptiveLossFunction`
3. Add comprehensive documentation
4. Include theoretical justification in the white paper
5. Provide experimental validation
